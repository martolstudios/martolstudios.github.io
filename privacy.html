    <h1>Privacy Policy for HungryHead</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 30, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Developer Contact Email:</strong> martolstudios@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to HungryHead. We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data in compliance with applicable privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal information such as names, emails, or phone numbers. However, through integrated SDKs (e.g., Unity Ads, InMobi, Meta), we may collect the following non-personally identifiable information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers, including the Android Advertising ID (AAID)</li>
        <li>App performance data, such as crashes, loading times, and errors</li>
        <li>Usage data, including impressions, clicks, and rewarded ad completions</li>
        <li>Approximate location data (coarse location), inferred via IP address or network data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serving ads (non-personalized or contextual)</li>
        <li>Measuring ad performance and preventing fraud</li>
        <li>Improving app stability and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Use of Third-Party SDKs</h2>
    <p>We use the following advertising and analytics SDKs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unity Ads</li>
        <li>InMobi</li>
        <li>Meta Audience Network</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These SDKs may collect or infer user data for legitimate interests, including ad frequency capping, fraud prevention, and performance analytics. All SDKs are integrated in compliance with platform policies, and no direct GPS or precise location data is accessed.</p>

    <h3>3.1 Location Data Collection</h3>
    <p>InMobi may collect coarse location data (approximate) based on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Network signals (e.g., Wi-Fi or mobile tower data)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is not used to track or locate users personally, and is handled according to InMobi's privacy practices. <br>

    <h2>4. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not directed specifically to children and no attempts are made to collect data from children under 13. Ads shown are not personalized, and all collected data is handled anonymously by our partners. Parents concerned about data collection can restrict ad tracking at the device level.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data transmitted via our app is protected using industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS). No data is stored or processed by us directly ‚Äî all data handling is delegated to third-party SDKs and governed by their policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Opt-Out Options</h2>
    <p>You can disable ad tracking at the device level:</p>
    <p><strong>Android:</strong> Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Ads ‚Üí ‚ÄúOpt out of Ads Personalization‚Äù</p>
    <p>Please note: since this app already uses non-personalized or contextual ads, disabling ad personalization has minimal impact on app behavior.</p>
